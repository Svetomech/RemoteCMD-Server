This application (if running on a target PC) allows you to send CMD, PowerShell or custom commands

Yes, I am perfectly aware of the code being an ugly mess. If you happen to think otherwise, here are some points:
- There is a lot of code repetition
- Bad hacks. Like, really bad (that one with getting file name from URL still makes me sick)
- Wrong class initializations
- Not following any coding style here
- Ignoring coding conventions I usually follow
- MUCH STATIC, SUCH PRIVATE
- The whole app logic is in one file

Kinda need to fix all of that. Maybe even rewrite the poor thing in the future.

Or at least do a refactoring. And a big one, actually. Eyyup.

    But then, you might ask, why did you publish it at all? Well, I answer:
    Was still learning basics of C# during that period and want you guys
    who are learning the language too to not follow the same path I did.
    Also there is no point in hiding good code (and I know there is some).
    So, eventually, I thought it'd be nice to share some results with you. Enjoy!
